Personal Control Panel

The Personal Control Panel is a control panel that is adapted to the user's needs and preferences. It lets the user edit his preferences, see the effects, and eventually overwrite his old settings.


How to use

1) Start GPII and log in with a user of your choice.

2) A firefox window should open http://localhost:8081/pcp/token/main (where "token" is your user's token).
This is the Personal Control Panel main page.

3) Modify the settings and press Update.

These new preferences will be merged into your preferences set and applied to the system, so you can see their effect.
However, they are not stored permanently - they are only a preview.
